# Nicole Thapa - MovieInfo Page Functionality Specifications

This page allows the user to view, interact, and read several pieces of information from the nthapa database in the following ways:

### Functionalities:

- Watch embedded YouTube trailers for the selected movie (from the dropdown). I created a new trailer column in the movies table for this
- View the Top 5 top-rated movies by average score given in the review table.
- The user can write data to the database (Movies table) by selecting a movie from the second dropdown and adding a summary to the movie they selected. I created a new column in the movies table for this
